This repository contains the complete codebase for a project that develops, fine-tunes, and deploys a specialized Large Language Model to automate the qualitative analysis of patient narratives concerning Abdominal Wall Hernia (AWH).

The project's core objective was to create a robust proof-of-concept AI tool that could ingest unstructured, free-text patient stories and transform them into a structured, multi-level JSON output, which is then used to generate a professional, multi-page PDF report.

## Key Features

- **Specialized Fine-Tuned Model**: A `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model fine-tuned on a high-fidelity synthetic dataset to understand and analyze clinical narratives related to hernia patient Quality of Life (QoL).
- **Automated JSON Analysis**: The model takes raw patient text and outputs a structured JSON object, breaking down the narrative into 5 core domains, 13+ subthemes, and associated clinical concepts.
- **Professional PDF Report Generation**: A script that takes the model's JSON output and programmatically generates a multi-page, professionally styled PDF report suitable for clinical review.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Gradio that allows for conversational interaction with the fine-tuned model, maintaining conversation history for context-aware analysis.
- **Efficient & Reproducible Pipeline**: The entire workflow, from data generation to final application, is documented and scripted for reproducibility.

## The Fine-Tuned Model

The final specialized model is publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub:

- **Model ID:** [**Laxmikant17/Llama-3-8B-Hernia-Analyst-600-Patients-8k**](https://huggingface.co/Laxmikant17/Llama-3-8B-Hernia-Analyst-600-Patients-8k)

This model was trained using QLoRA on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, leveraging its full 8192-token context window to analyze long-form patient narratives.

## Technical Architecture & Pipeline

The project was executed in a four-phase pipeline, moving from data creation to a final, usable application.

Repository Structure

This repository contains the scripts for each major phase of the project:

final_data_generation_code.py: Phase 1. Script to generate the synthetic patient dataset using a hybrid procedural and LLM-based approach.

fine_tune_increased_token.py: Phase 2. The complete script for fine-tuning the Llama 3 8B model on the generated dataset.

final_version_testing_latest_model_with_pdf.py: Phase 3. The final application that runs inference on a patient file and generates a detailed PDF report.

chatbot_with_interface.py: Phase 4. A script to launch a user-friendly Gradio web interface for interactive chat with the model.

requirements.txt: A list of all necessary Python packages.

Setup and Usage
Prerequisites

Python 3.9+

Git

An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is required for fine-tuning and local inference with the full model.

1. Clone the Repository
code
Bash

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Environment Variables

You will need API keys for Hugging Face and Google (for data generation). Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your keys:

code
Code

expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_api_token"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"

Note: The scripts provided use Google Colab's userdata for secrets management. For local execution, you would need to modify the scripts to load these variables from the .env file (e.g., using the python-dotenv library).

4. Running the Scripts

The scripts are designed to be run in sequence within a Google Colab environment, but can be adapted for local execution.

Generate the Dataset:

Run the final_data_generation_code.py notebook. This will produce the patients_dataset.json file.

You will need to manually process this into the (input, output) .jsonl format for the next step.

Fine-Tune the Model:

Run the fine_tune_increased_token.py notebook.

Upload your .jsonl training file when prompted.

This will train the model and save the LoRA adapter.

Run the Final Application (Inference & PDF Report):

Run the final_version_testing_latest_model_with_pdf.py notebook.

First, it will load the model and ask for a patient's raw data file. It will run the analysis and save an analysis_of_[...].json file.

The second part of the script will then ask for this analysis file to generate the final Detailed_Report_for_[...].pdf.

Launch the Chatbot Interface:

Run the chatbot_with_interface.py notebook.

This will load the model and provide a public Gradio URL for you to interact with the chatbot in your browser.
